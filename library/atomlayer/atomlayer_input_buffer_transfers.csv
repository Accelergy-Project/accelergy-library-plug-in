# Power calculation for input buffers:
# Power * Time / (Reads+Writes) = Energy per read/write
# (1.24e-3 W) power * (16 * 100e-9s time/MAC / 1.2) / (128+128 reads+writes)
# (1.24e-3) * (16 * 100e-9 / 1.2) / (128+128) * 1e12
# Now for the transfers calculation, we also mark write energy = 0 so we don't
# double charge for writes with the actual buffers. Only charge for reads when
# another
# buffer reads from the inter-buffer transfer network.
